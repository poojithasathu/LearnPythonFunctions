# Exploring Functions and subsetting data in Python
This project demonstrates data manipulation using Pandas and functions in Python. In this project, we'll learn: 
- How to use iloc function for subsetting a dataset 
- How to create functions in python and how to call those functions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.11.4, Pandas library

### Installing
1. Create a new repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pandas`

## Running the Tests

### Breakdown of Tests

1. `pizza_welcome` function test:
   - Tests the functionality of printing the given statement when the function is called.
   - Run the test script: 'python test_pizza_welcome.py'
2. `waiting` function test:
   - Tests the functionality of extracting elements of a list and uses a loop to print the statement when the function is called.
   - Run the test script: 'python test_waiting.py'
3. `subset_data` function test:
   - Tests the functionality of extracting specific rows and columns from a DataFrame.
   - Run the test script: `python test_subset_data.py`

## Deployment
This project can be used by installing the necessary libraries (pandas) and importing the scripts into your Python environment and running the script.
